"ternyata python itu bukan ular. kenapa sih hal kecil kayak gini saja harus bohong"

Hello, welcome to **MyPython**! 🎉
This repository is a place for me to experiment, try new things, and hone my skills in the programming language **Python**. If you also like coding with Python, let's learn together! 😃

## 🌟 Why Python?

Python is like a utility knife in the world of programming! 🔪✨ Can be used for various things, such as:

- **Data Science & Machine Learning** 📊🧠
- **Web Development** 🌍
